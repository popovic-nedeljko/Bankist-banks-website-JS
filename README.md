# Bankist - banks website project

[Bankist-website](https://bankist-bankswebsite.netlify.app/)

Bank website created by following Jonas Schmedtmann javascript course on Udemy. State of the art DOM manipulation.

```
Creating the website expanded my knowledge about DOM manipulation.
```

### Site funcionalities:

- When clicking anywhere in the navigation, it goes to the relevant part of the page with a "smooth scroll" effect.

- Window effect when clicking "Open account" at the top right and "Open your free account today!" at the bottom.

- Using Intersection Observer for the page loading when page is scrolled down.(Essential for fast-loading performance sites).

- Tab effect in the "Operations" section of the site.
  And at the bottom of the page is the comment slider, which looks like an image slider.

- Mobile optimized website.(responsive media queries for all devices).
